- Semgrep for pattern matching
- Custom rule sets for DeFi patterns

FOCUS_AREAS:
- Access control mechanisms
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Unchecked external calls
- State variable manipulation
- Token approval patterns
```

### Dynamic Testing

```
SETUP:
- Local fork of mainnet
- Isolated testing environment
- Mock oracles and price feeds
- Simulated market conditions

SCENARIOS:
- Flash loan attacks
- Sandwich attacks
- Price manipulation
- Liquidation scenarios
- Edge case transactions
```

### Code Review Targets

```python
# Priority areas for manual review
REVIEW_PRIORITIES = [
    "reward_calculation_logic",
    "asset_transfer_functions", 
    "access_control_modifiers",
    "external_call_patterns",
    "state_update_sequences",
    "emergency_pause_mechanisms"
]
```

## Specific Attack Vectors

### Flash Loan Attacks

- Identify lending pools that can be drained
- Test price manipulation via large trades
- Exploit arbitrage opportunities
- Manipulate collateral ratios

### Reentrancy Patterns

- Check for cross-function reentrancy
- Test read-only reentrancy attacks
- Verify state updates before external calls
- Analyze callback mechanisms

### Oracle Manipulation

- Test price feed dependencies
- Identify single point of failure oracles
- Exploit time-weighted average price (TWAP) delays
- Manipulate liquidity pool prices

### Access Control Issues

- Test role-based permissions
- Verify multi-signature requirements
- Check for privilege escalation paths
- Analyze emergency functions

## Testing Framework

### Environment Setup

```solidity
// Testing template
contract CorePlatformTest {
    function setUp() public {
        // Fork mainnet at specific block
        vm.createFork(MAINNET_RPC_URL, BLOCK_NUMBER);
        
        // Deploy test contracts
        // Initialize with realistic parameters
        // Set up attack scenarios
    }
    
    function testVulnerability() public {
        // Implement specific exploit
        // Measure impact
        // Verify state changes
    }
}
```

### Attack Simulation

        "funds_at_risk": calculate_funds_at_risk(),
        "attack_complexity": "low|medium|high",
        "prerequisites": list_prerequisites(),
        "impact_description": describe_impact()
    }
